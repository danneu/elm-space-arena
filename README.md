- Live demo: <https://www.danneu.com/elm-space-arena>

A sloppy 2D spaceship shooter built with Elm to explore game development.

It's a work-in-progress with shameful code.

## Technical

- `(x, y)` starts at the top-left.
  `x` increases going right, `y` increases going down.
- `position` is always the center of an entity.
